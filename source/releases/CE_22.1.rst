22.1  "Observant Owl" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 7 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

22.1, nicknamed "Observant Owl", features the upgrade to FreeBSD 13,
switch to logging supporting RFC 5424 with severity filtering, improved
tunable sysctl value integration, faster boot sequence and interface
initiation and dynamic IPv6 host alias support amongst others.

On the flip side major operating system changes bear risk for regression
and feature removal, e.g. no longer supporting insecure cryptography in
the kernel for IPsec and switching the Realtek vendor driver back to its
FreeBSD counterpart which does not yet support the newer 2.5G models.
Circular logging support has also been removed.  Make sure to read the
known issues and limitations below before attempting to upgrade.

22.1.2 (March 01, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This release adds GUI support for Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT) and
SYN cookies as per virtue of the FreeBSD 13 operating system.  The work
to modernise the interfaces subsystem and improve the new ddclient dynamic
DNS plugin are also progressing.

Due to signs of decay in the build infrastructure, license nitpicking
in FreeBSD ports and the upcoming OpenSSL 3 release (which will complicate
things most likely) we have decided to discontinue LibreSSL at the end of
this year meaning there will be no more LibreSSL flavour starting with
version 23.1.  Non-essential software will no longer be manually fixed and
provided as binary packages if broken by upstream from this point on.

Since 2015 we have been working on functional LibreSSL support with steady
means, but 7 years later and OpenSSL making an effort through numerous
ways we are sad to give up this alternative since we do not see LibreSSL
being used and properly integrated in software projects as often anymore.
It has been a slow but steady decline for the past 2 years that also has
to do with a LibreSSL release cycle tailored for OpenBSD in particular and
OpenSSL library integration quality, which is almost impossible to improve
upon in complex third-party software projects.  We simply cannot afford the
time for it any longer.

All users are able to update to the OpenSSL flavour without issues now or
at any later given point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The first stable release brings in minor fixes from FreeBSD and instant
log file visibility for files without severity written which can happen

Known issues and limitations:

* This release contains a new major operating system version and should be carried out with the necessary care.  Despite extended test coverage changes made by FreeBSD may still affect operation without our knowledge.  Except for ZFS boot environments rollbacks between major operating system versions are extremely fragile and a reinstall of an older version should be attempted in the worst case.  For more information please consult the FreeBSD 13.0 release notes `[28] <https://www.freebsd.org/releases/13.0R/relnotes/>`__ .
* IPsec hash and cipher removals in FreeBSD 13 can affect existing setups as insecure cryptographic options have been removed upstream.  If you are using MD5, Blowfish, DES, 3DES, or CAST128 in your phase 2 please move to more secure settings prior to the upgrade.  Note that phase 1 settings are unaffected, but insecure settings should still be avoided.  For more information see the FreeBSD commit in question `[29] <https://github.com/opnsense/src/commit/16aabb761c0a>`__ .
* The Realtek vendor driver is no longer bundled with the updated FreeBSD kernel.  If unsure whether FreeBSD 13 supports your Realtek NIC please install the os-realtek-re plugin prior to upgrading to retain operability of your NICs.
* MAC spoofing now only pertains to the configured interface and not the VLAN siblings or parent interface.  This can introduce unwanted configuration due to previous side effects in the code.  Make sure to assign and set the spoofed MAC for all interfaces that require a spoofed MAC or simply spoof the MAC on the parent and leave the VLAN sibling settings empty to let them follow the parent MAC automatically.  If in doubt the parent interface can be set into promiscuous mode now to allow for mixed MAC address use across VLANs too.
* Media and hardware offload settings are no longer shown for non-parent interfaces and need to be set individually on the parent interface to take effect.  This can introduce unwanted configuration due to previous side effects in the code.  If the parent interface was not previously assigned please assign it to reapply the required settings.
* NTPD defaults changed to exclude the "iburst" option by default.  "limited" setting was detached from "kod" option.  In both cases configuration adjustments can achieve previous behaviour if required.
* Rebind checks through os-dyndns or os-rfc2136 will no longer work due to the deprecation of both plugins.  Please add your rebind hosts manually or disable rebind protection prior to the upgrade.
* GRE link1 support has been removed and needs a static route to function now.
* Circular logging support has been removed.  No user interaction is required.

Known issues and limitations:

* This release contains a new major operating system version and should be carried out with the necessary care.  Despite extended test coverage changes made by FreeBSD may still affect operation without our knowledge.
* MAC spoofing now only pertains to the configured interface and not the VLAN siblings or parent interface.  This can introduces unwanted configuration due to previous side effects in the code.  Make sure to assign and set the spoofed MAC for all interfaces that require a spoofed MAC.
* Media settings are no longer shown for non-parent interfaces and need to be set individually to take effect.  This can introduce unwanted configuration due to previous side effects in the code.  If the parent interface was not previously assigned please assign it to reapply the required media settings.
* Router advertisement static mode option is still subject to change in this release candidate series.
* IPsec hash and cipher removals in FreeBSD 13 can affect existing setups as insecure cryptographic options have been removed upstream.  For more information see the FreeBSD commit in question `[21] <https://github.com/opnsense/src/commit/16aabb761c0a>`__ .  We will be adding an explict configuration check to 21.7 before its end of life.
* Circular logging support has been removed.  No user interaction is required.
* The migration notes are subject to change and will be extended as needed in the upcoming weeks.
