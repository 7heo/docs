24.7  "Thriving Tiger" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 9 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation
through modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

24.7, nicknamed "Thriving Tiger", features a new dashboard, system trust
MVC/API support, GRE and GIF MVC/API support, NAT 1-to-1 MVC/API support,
WireGuard QR code generator, dynamic IPsec VTI tunnel support, experimental
OpenVPN DCO support, FreeBSD 14.1, Python 3.11 plus much more.

The upgrade path from 24.1.x will follow tomorrow.  Do not be hasty.
The major operating system upgrade has not happened in while and should
be taken with the appropriate amount of care.

24.7.3 (August 29, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today we are switching pf stateful tracking of ICMPv6 neighbour discoveries
off in order to fix the previous instability with the FreeBSD security
advisory first shipped in 24.7.1.  We do this in order to provide the same
reliable IPv6 functionality that was on all previous versions prior to
24.7.1 at the cost of resurfacing CVE-2024-6640 until a better solution
has been devised.  A link to the long and difficult upstream bug report is
included below.

But that is not all.  The GUI gains snapshot support on ZFS installations by
implementing what is called "boot environments" which allows one to move
seamlessly from one snapshot to another via reboot.  This functionality can
also be accessed from the boot loader menu option "8" for a quick recovery
ensuring that at least one other snapshot was created to boot into.  A very
special thank you to Sheridan Computers for contributing this feature.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: add snapshots (boot environments) support via MVC/API (contributed by Sheridan Computers)
* system: remove obsolete dashboard sync
* system: compact services widget on dashboard
* system: convert lock mode to edit mode on dashboard
* system: link certificates by subject on import
* system: unify how log search clauses work and add a search time constraint

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
24.7.2 (August 21, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Today a follow-up for the FreeBSD security advisory for pf/ICMP
ships that addresses the undesired traceroute behaviour.  A few
dashboard improvements are included as well as better IPv6 recovery
for dhcp6c and assorted stability fixes.

As a special note we now have native CPU microcode update plugins
for either AMD or Intel to install from the GUI.  Apart from a reboot
these plugins require no further user interaction and will keep the
applicable microcode at the latest known version as shipped in the
packages repository.

We are currently working on making PPP capable of running in
IPv6-only deployments; additionally ZFS snapshots (a.k.a boot environments)
are coming to the next stable release and can already be previewed in
the bundled development version.

Last but not least, an "importmap" free dashboard version is also
ready for testing in the development release.  We hereby ask for
feedback so that it can be included in a subsequent stable release.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: CRL import ignored text input and triggered unrelated validations
* system: improve the locking during web GUI restart

24.7.1 (August 08, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This release includes a batch of dashboard changes due to the reliable
feedback we have received from you all so far.  There will be more dashboard
changes in the future mostly relating to UX and sane default behaviour
so just know we are aware.

A few smaller regressions due to the Phalcon module replacement efforts
have been fixed as well.  IPv6 behaviour has been adjusted for SLAAC and
the web GUI.

Last but not least we found and fixed a number of issues with FreeBSD 14.1
and are including its security advisories from yesterday while at it.

MVC/API conversions are already being carried out in the development version
and it seems that PPP-related connectivity will get a bigger makeover too.
The roadmap for 25.1 will be discussed and likely published later this month.

24.7.r1 (July 16, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


If you have not heard: 24.7-RC1 is an online update. You can update
from the 24.7-BETA and switch to the community release type for the
stable track which leads into 24.7.x.  The development version of the
upcoming 24.1.11 release will also be able to update to the RC. An RC2
will follow up with the relevant images and additional information at
the end of the week.

Here are the full changes against version 24.1.10:

* system: remove "load_balancer" configuration remnants from core
* system: replace usage of mt_rand() with random_int()
* system: rewrote Trust configuration using MVC/API
* system: add XMLRPC option for OpenDNS
* system: rewrote the high availability settings page using MVC/API
* system: remove obsolete SSH DSA key handling
* system: replaced the dashboard with a modern alternative with streaming widgets
* system: harden a number of PHP settings according to best practices
* system: support streaming of log files for the new dashboard widget
* interfaces: rewrote GRE configuration using MVC/API
* interfaces: rewrote GIF configuration using MVC/API
* interfaces: temporary flush SLAAC addresses in DHCPv6 WAN mode to avoid using them primarily
* interfaces: add peer/peer6 options to CARP VIPs
* interfaces: allow to assign a prefix ID to WAN interface in DHCPv6 as well
* interfaces: allow to set manual interface ID in DHCPv6 and tracking modes
* firewall: performance improvements in alias handling
* firewall: refactor pftop output, move search to controller layer and implement cache for sessions page
* firewall: support streaming of filter logs for the new dashboard widget
* captive portal: add "Allow inbound" option to select interfaces which may enter the zone
* captive portal: remove defunct transparent proxy settings
* captive portal: clean up the codebase
* ipsec: prevent gateway when remote gateway family does not match selected protocol in legacy tunnel configuration
* isc-dhcp: do not reload DNS services when editing static mappings to match behaviour with Kea
* monit: expose HTTPD username and password settings to GUI
* openvpn: optionally support DCO devices for instances
* openvpn: remove duplicate and irrelevant data for the client session in question
* openvpn: add "remote_cert_tls" option to instances
* backend: add "cache_ttl" parameter to allow for generic caching of actions
* backend: run default action "configd actions" when none was specified
* backend: extended support for streaming actions
* ui: assorted improvements for screen readers (contributed by Jason Fayre)
* ui: add "select all" to standard form selectors and remove dialog on "clear all" for tokenizers
* ui: lock save button while in progress to prevent duplicate input on Bootgrid
* ui: backport accessibility fix in Bootstrap
* mvc: replaced most of the Phalcon MVC use with a native band compatible implementation
* mvc: improve searchRecordsetBase() filtering capabilities
* mvc: improve container field cloning
* plugins: os-acme-client 4.4 `[1] <https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/blob/stable/24.7/security/acme-client/pkg-descr>`__ 
* plugins: os-etpro-telemetry 1.7 replaces dashboard widget
* src: FreeBSD 14.1-RELEASE `[2] <https://www.freebsd.org/releases/14.1R/relnotes/>`__ 
* ports: phalcon 5.8.0 `[3] <https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/v5.8.0>`__ 

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* The dashboard has been replaced. Widgets from the old format are no longer supported and need to be rewritten by the respective authors.
* ISC DHCP will no longer reload DNS services on static mapping edits. This is for feature parity with Kea DHCP and avoiding cross-service complications. If you expect your static mappings to show up in a particular DNS service please restart this service manually.

24.7.b (June 13, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Since OPNsense 24.7 will be based on a newer FreeBSD major version
it is crucial for us to release these BETA images based on the latest
development state. This is not meant for production use but all plugins
are provided and future updates of installations based on these images
will be possible.

https://pkg.opnsense.org/releases/24.7/

There is a bit more work to be done yet most of the milestones have
already been reached. If you have a test deployment or would like to
check out some of the new features these images are for you. Together
we can make OPNsense better than it ever was.

The final release date for 24.7 is July 24.  A release candidate will
follow in early July.

Highlights over the current 24.1 series include:

* Dashboard replacement with streaming widgets
* System: High Availability: Settings page has been converted to MVC
* System: Trust section has been converted to MVC/API
* Interfaces: GIF section has been converted to MVC/API
* Interfaces: GRE section has been converted to MVC/API
* Firewall: NAT 1-to-1 has been converted to MVC/API
* Added experimental OpenVPN DCO device type support
* Added unicast CARP support to Virtual IPs
* DHCPv6 on WAN can now assign a prefix subnet to itself and support static interface identifiers
* Built-in cache capability for backend commands
* Captive portal backend refactor and new "Allow inbound interfaces" option
* Large portions of Phalcon MVC have been replaced by native PHP implementation
* FreeBSD 14.1

The public key for the 24.7 series is:
