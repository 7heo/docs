===========================================================================================
21.1  "Marvelous Meerkat" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 6 years, OPNsense is driving innovation through modularising
and hardening the open source firewall, with simple and reliable firmware
upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD security, fast adoption of
upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

21.1, nicknamed "Marvelous Meerkat", is the relentless continuation of
open source dedication.  The last 6 years were not always easy, but we
are happy to be where we are now and have the community to thank for it.

New and improved are the firewall rules and NAT categories, the traffic
graphs supporting IPv6 along with a visual refresh,  intrusion detection
rule management by policies, an alias for MAC addresses and NAT over IPsec
with all phase 2 you could ever want.  Last but not least, the serial image
now supports UEFI as well.

For those wondering, the WireGuard plugin has been available since 2019 and
receives continuous improvements by its maintainer and various users alike.
And that is unlikey to change in the future.  ;)

As we continue to deprecate custom configuration inputs for a number of
reasons, Dnsmasq has been switched to a pluggable file-based approach `[1] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/dnsmasq.html>`__ 
with Unbound to follow in the upcoming 21.7 series.

Download links, an installation guide `[2] <https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/install.html>`__  and the checksums for the images
can be found below as well.

21.1.2 (February 23, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Please do enjoy this round of timely crypto library updates and
other reliability fixes.

Work has so far been focused on the firmware update process to ensure
its safety around edge cases and recovery methods for the worst case.
To that end 21.1.3 will likely receive the full revamp including API and
GUI changes for a swift transition after thorough testing of the changes
now available in the development package of this release.

21.1.1 (February 09, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The 21.1 series debut looks pretty good so far.  Thanks again for your
input and comments!

We will be spending a lot of time this year improving and adapting the
code base.  As a first glimpse, the changes of this stable update are a
mix of security and reliability updates coupled with preparations for the
update framework revamp we have planned for 21.7.  The roadmap is still
not final, but will likely contain long-yearned-for features.  Stay tuned.
