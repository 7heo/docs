Backups via secure copy (sftp)
====================================================

When your remote host supports SSH, it's often possible to use sftp as well, which can be used for file transfers
in a secure manner between machines (in this case your firewall and the backup target).

In order to use this feature, one has to install the sftp-backup plugin first (in :menuselection:`System->Firmware->Plugins` search for os-sftp-backup).

--------------------------
Preparation
--------------------------

Before configuring the plugin, make sure your target machine has ssh enabled and is reachable.
You also need a private/public key combination which the backup machine will trust.

Generate a key with the command below (`-f` specifies the filename) and omit a password in the process:

.. code-block::
    :caption: ssh-keygen

    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" -f my_new_key


The output will look like this:

.. code-block::
    :caption: ssh-keygen (sample output)

    Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved in my_new_key
    Your public key has been saved in my_new_key.pub
    The key fingerprint is:
    SHA256:DJ+Jj1xeuezYLYaqOQg9DBa8ETmOuausIf1rNKeuMQs your_email@example.com
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ED25519 256]--+
    |..o              |
    | *               |
    |o.=   .          |
    |++     = o .     |
    |.=    . S o      |
    |o.+ o..= o .     |
    |Eo++ +o o.o      |
    |+o.=+.  .+o.     |
    |=.o+*+....o..    |
    +----[SHA256]-----+


This creates two files, `my_new_key` and `my_new_key.pub`, the first one is private and should not be shared, the other
is public and offered to the backup machine.

Next we will add the `my_new_key.pub` file to the `authorized_keys` file in the users `.ssh` directory (e.g. `/home/opnsense/.ssh/authorized_keys`).

.. Note::

    Make sure the `.ssh` directory is only readable and writebable by the owner and `authorized_keys` has the same rights.
    (`chmod 600` for the file `chmod 700` for the directory)


.. Tip::

    Create a separate key for the backup (don't use the same one elsewhere), so you can easily drop access later.


--------------------------
Initial setup
--------------------------

The configuration part of this plugin is quite basic and offers two types of transport modes, https using a username and
password combination or ssh using public key infrastructure.

=====================================================================================================================

====================================  ===============================================================================
Enable                                Enable backup to the upstream target
URL                                   Target location, which defines protocol, user and path. This may look like:
                                      `sftp://opnsense@192.168.1.10//home/opnsense/config_backups`
SSH private key                       Upload the `my_new_key` file created during preperation.
Backup Count                          Number of backups to keep
Encrypt Password                      Password used to encrypt the backup (optional)
====================================  ===============================================================================



--------------------------
Finish and test
--------------------------


After willing in the details, press "Setup/Test sftp" to validate if it works.
When connectivity isn't possible, the error will be reported.

.. Tip::

    For advanced debugging use `sftp` on the command line, this plugin uses the same tool and reports the same errors.
